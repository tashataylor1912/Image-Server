##### Serving images from wew.io

### Intro
The imageserver will server-side scale and adapt images to the end-user's current context. It supports both responsive and static designs. 

### Getting started

2. Register an application to get an application key and service URL.

### Examples
## Basic - static design
To scale an image to an absolute width 320px, create your #img#-url like in the example below.
