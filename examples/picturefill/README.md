# Using with "Picturefill"

This example uses Scott Jehl's [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) in combination with server side image resizing.

The Picturefill implementation supports viewport breakpoints and retina resolution using media queries in the markup.

In the example we've defined breakpoints at 320, 480 and 1000 pixels and also defined highres image URLs for retina displays.
